Got it 👍 — you want to **make fewer pages** for your **tournament website**, right?

Let’s clarify so I can give the best layout:
Do you want:

1. A **simple site** (like 3–5 pages total)?
2. Or a **single-page site** (everything — register, view matches, leaderboard, payment — on one scrolling page)?

---

If we go for **few pages (recommended 4 total)**, here’s a clean setup:

### 🔹 Page 1 – Home / Dashboard

* Tournament name, banner
* Join / Create match button
* View live or upcoming matches

### 🔹 Page 2 – Matches

* Room ID, password (for custom matches)
* Player list + status (Joined / Pending / Prize given)

### 🔹 Page 3 – Payments

* Choose entry amount ($1, $5, $10…)
* Pay via crypto (NowPayments / CoinGate)
* Auto-confirm participant

### 🔹 Page 4 – Results & Leaderboard

* Winners list
* Prizes distributed (✅ / ❌)
* Match stats

---

Would you like me to:

* 🧱 Make a **wireframe / structure plan** (show how pages connect)?
* 💻 Or generate the **actual HTML + JS code** for this reduced version?
